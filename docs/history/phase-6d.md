## Phase 6D — Today enhancements

**Status:** Done (2026-08-02, PR #TBD)
**Goal:** The suggestion's filters become visible and adjustable on Today, a
plan day can be rowed as a different type without abandoning the plan, and a
session can be logged without consuming a plan slot.
**Design authority:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-02-today-enhancements-design.md`,
plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-02-today-enhancements.md`.

- [x] `suggest.ts`/`suggestFreestyle` learn a `painMax3` filter and a
      capless (`timeCapMinutes: null`) cap, on top of the existing
      difficulty/cap filters; `buildReason` names only the dimensions it
      actually checked (a capless or `durationsUnknown` cap drops the "…
      within your N min cap" clause instead of asserting something never
      verified, the same discipline `durationsUnknown` already established)
- [x] `todayOverrides.ts`: an ephemeral, `localStorage`-only record keyed
      `{date, planKey, doneN}` (the same invalidation contract as
      `todayPick.ts`'s own pick) layered on the server's `SuggestPrefs`
      without ever writing back to them. Today (`/today`) gains two chip
      rows: EASY/MEDIUM/HARD (multi) · `≤30′ ≤45′ ≤60′ ≤90′ NO CAP`
      (single-select cap) · `PAIN ≤3` (toggle) in both plan and freestyle
      modes, plus AN/O2/AT/TR type-swap chips (plan mode only) that
      override the day's prescribed type before `suggest()` runs — the
      plan line reads `SESSION 5 OF 84 · O2` unswapped, `… · O2 → AT`
      swapped. A session logged since (the `doneN` bump) invalidates the
      stored record and the swap/filters reset to the preference-derived
      default
- [x] `advancesPlan`: an additive, optional boolean on `POST /api/logs`
      (default `true` ≡ every prior caller's behavior byte-for-byte),
      gating only the `plan_state` upsert inside `logs.ts`'s `create`
      transaction — the log row itself always inserts regardless. The Log
      screen gains a single toggle row (both doors, only when a plan is
      active): `COUNTS TOWARD PLAN · SESSION {n} OF {total}` untapped,
      `OUTSIDE THE PLAN — won't advance` tapped — a genuine make-up session
      or a second same-day log can now be recorded without silently eating
      a plan slot meant for one real session
- [x] Full-flow e2e for all four shapes (visible filters actually narrowing
      the card, the swap loop through a real Start → SKIP → complete →
      Log → Save round trip with the swap's own reset proved afterward, the
      outside-plan toggle proving the counter stays put, and a freestyle
      spot-check that the type chips genuinely don't render without a
      plan), plus structural design coverage: the chip row's default
      aria-pressed state, the swap arrow appearing/clearing, and — closing
      a gap Task 3's own review flagged — the Log screen's plan toggle
      measured and axed in BOTH states for the first time, since no earlier
      screenshot or design sweep had ever activated a plan on that screen

**Exit:** MET — a rower can narrow today's suggestion live from the Today
screen itself, row a plan day as a different type without losing plan
progress (the swap resets cleanly once that session is logged), and log a
genuine off-plan or make-up session without moving the plan's counter.
