# Antagonist ledger

Claims this project believed that turned out false, and **the technique that
settled each**. Read by the `antagonist` agent before every engagement.

The techniques are the durable part. The next antagonist should inherit a
toolkit, not a history.

## Falsified claims, and how

- **"The paused derivation depends on seeing zero stroke rates."** Believed
  because a long comment discussed `spm === 0` at length. False: that passage is
  the epitaph of a DELETED predicate, and the live guard is on
  `distanceMeters <= 0`. **Technique:** replayed all 25,511 captured frames
  through verbatim copies of the real functions and compared paused sequences
  byte-for-byte. Reading the comment produced the wrong answer; running the code
  over real data produced the right one.

- **"These three e2e pins are vacuous — `overflow: clip` makes scrollHeight
  equal clientHeight."** Believed because a 4000px child was injected and the
  numbers did not move. False: the container is a flex COLUMN, so the child was
  shrunk to 205px and the probe never violated the invariant. With `flex: none`
  it gives 4127 vs 344. **Technique:** before believing a probe's result,
  confirm the probe produced the state it claims to test. Check the computed
  box, not the requested one. Acting on this would have deleted three working
  geometry pins.

- **"`max(left, right)` fixed a rotation asymmetry James saw on his phone."**
  False: iOS reports the landscape side inset on BOTH sides regardless of which
  side the housing is on, and CSS cannot tell which side it is, by design. The
  one-sided condition came from our own CDP override, where we chose the side.
  **Technique:** ask where the input came from. An asymmetry that only appears
  under a harness you control is the harness's, until a primary source says
  otherwise. (The fix was kept — Android's `DisplayCutout` really is asymmetric.)

- **"The corners of a notched edge are clear, so the tap targets can move
  outboard."** True about the CAMERA (LIVE clears it by 76.5px) and false about
  the constraint: Apple states the landscape inset protects the sensor housing
  AND the rounded corners, and the corner radius is roughly equal to the inset
  (55 vs 59, 62 vs 62). **Technique:** when a reservation seems too large, ask
  what ELSE it might be reserving before assuming waste. The vendor documents it.

- **"A required field on a persisted type is a migration hazard."** Structurally
  true, consequentially false: the field has one consumer, and the program
  reaching it is always freshly compiled, never loaded from storage. **Technique:**
  trace the readers BACKWARD from the persisted shape, not the field forward from
  its type. The original analysis went forward and never checked who reads.

- **"The session accumulator over-counts because the clock drops at work/rest
  boundaries."** False, and it was written into the ROADMAP where an investigator
  would have followed it. Measured: work→rest never drops the clock (0 of 7);
  rest→work drops once, correctly (4 of 4). The real cause is Terminate re-bases,
  where elapsed jumps back to a non-zero value while distance stands still.
  **Technique:** count the events in the captures rather than reasoning about
  which events should exist. 9 of 25 drops did not reset distance, which no
  amount of reasoning would have produced.

## Techniques that keep paying

1. **Replay the committed captures.** Most wire questions are already answered in
   `docs/monitor/sessions/*.log.gz`. No hardware, no speculation.
2. **Make the probe bite before trusting its silence.** Demonstrate the failure
   the assertion claims to prevent.
3. **Trace backward from the consumer**, not forward from the definition.
4. **Ask where a measurement came from.** Our own harness is a suspect.
5. **Check what a reservation is reserving.** Vendors document it; we guessed.
6. **Count, do not characterise.** "Sometimes" and "roughly" hide the answer.
7. **Compare against the external authority.** Every internal gate agreed with
   every other internal gate while the app read 16938 m and the erg read 4384.

## Things attacked and found sound

- The single-writer discipline on the run record, and its refusal to be
  re-derived.
- `verifyArmed` reading the machine's own state back rather than trusting an
  acknowledgement.
- One judgement call site, enforced by a census test, held across seven phases.
- The view layer deriving everything and storing nothing.
