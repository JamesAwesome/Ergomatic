## Phase 3 — iOS app shell (Capacitor)

**Status:** Done
**Goal:** Ergomatic on household iPhones via internal TestFlight — same web code, native shell. (iOS-only for now by design; Capacitor keeps an Android target one `npx cap add android` away if ever wanted.)
**Research:** `docs/superpowers/research/2026-07-27-capacitor-vs-react-native.md` (Capacitor chosen 91:63 over React Native — full UI reuse, BLE plugin mirrors Web Bluetooth, solo-dev economics).

- [x] Capacitor project in `app/` (iOS target; bundled local assets, NOT remote-URL mode)
- [x] Native auth path: system-browser Google sign-in → `serverAuthCode` → new Express exchange endpoint → bearer session token stored in iOS Keychain (cookie flow untouched for web)
- [x] `requireUser` accepts cookie OR `Authorization: Bearer` (bearer requests skip the Origin check — no ambient credential, no CSRF)
- [x] Keep-awake during live timer (WKWebView suspends JS when locked/backgrounded)
- [x] Build/upload runbook: Xcode archive → internal TestFlight (no App Review; 90-day re-upload cadence documented)
- [x] Apple Developer account prerequisites documented

**Exit:** James signs in and logs a workout in the TestFlight build on an iPhone; web app behavior unchanged.
