# Ergomatic

Mobile-first rowing (erg) workout tracker/planner around The Erg Book model.
Roadmap: `ROADMAP.md` (phases + standing rules). Design reference: `docs/design/`
(high-fidelity; 44px hit targets and WCAG AA are hard requirements).

## Layout

- `app/` — the deployable: `src/` (React 19 + Vite client), `server/` (Express 5 API),
  `domain/` (pure Erg Book logic — no framework imports allowed)
- Root `package.json` exists only to host husky hooks. Run `pnpm install` at root
  AND in `app/`.
- `app/pnpm-workspace.yaml` is auto-generated pnpm config (`allowBuilds` for esbuild,
  plus other keys pnpm adds during installs) and makes `app/` its own pnpm workspace
  root, so the repo-root `.npmrc` does not apply inside `app/`.

## Commands (run in `app/`)

- `pnpm dev` / `pnpm dev:server` — Vite client :5173 (proxies /api) / API :8080
- `pnpm lint` · `pnpm format` / `pnpm format:check` · `pnpm typecheck` · `pnpm test` ·
  `pnpm test:coverage` (90% gate) · `pnpm build`
- Single Vitest project: `pnpm test --project unit|client|integration`
- `pnpm e2e` — Playwright flows + structural design assertions against the real
  compose stack (boots it if not running). `pnpm screenshots` — captures
  `docs/screenshots/*.png` the same way. `pnpm mutate` — Stryker mutation testing,
  on-demand (see docs/TESTING.md §3); minutes, not part of the push/CI gate.
- Local dev DB: `docker run --rm -d --name erg-dev-pg -p 5433:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev postgres:18.4`
  then `DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:dev@localhost:5433/postgres pnpm dev:server`.
  The server refuses to start without `DATABASE_URL` (no dotenv — real env only).
- Local OAuth: set `SITE_URL=http://localhost:5173` when running `dev:server`
  (redirect URI derives from it; without it Google errors redirect_uri_mismatch):
  `DATABASE_URL=... SITE_URL=http://localhost:5173 GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=... GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=... ALLOWED_EMAILS=you@gmail.com pnpm dev:server`

## Rules

- **SDLC (binding for all agents — brief every subagent with this bullet before
  it starts work):** All implementation happens in git worktrees, never in the
  main checkout; tear the worktree down immediately after its PR merges (and
  only then). **Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before every commit and
  confirm it prints your worktree path** — three agents have committed to the
  main checkout despite being told not to; the check catches it, the
  instruction alone does not. **No PR merges without James's explicit
  approval** — green CI and a clean final review are necessary but not
  sufficient; present the review verdict and stop. Subagents never merge,
  close, or approve PRs and never remove worktrees; main is PR-only, no merge
  commits.
- **Native-first:** the iOS app is the primary surface; design decisions
  favor it. The web build is the same code serving as test harness
  (Playwright/design/screenshots), dev loop, and fallback — never dropped,
  never polished at the app's expense. Platform conditionals live ONLY in
  the adapter layer (`src/platform.ts`, `src/api.ts`, `src/native/`,
  `src/adapters/` — lint-enforced via no-restricted-imports).
- **Verify current versions before adding/pinning any dependency** (`npm view <pkg> version`).
  Never trust versions from memory or other repos. TypeScript stays `~6.0.x` until
  typescript-eslint's peer range admits 7 (check `npm view typescript-eslint peerDependencies`).
- Testing policy: docs/TESTING.md governs — the pyramid, naming/assertion-quality
  rules, coverage stance, contract-test rule, and structural design assertions all
  live there. Read it before writing or reviewing tests.
- TDD: failing test first. Domain code gets the heaviest coverage.
- Hooks: pre-commit = lint-staged + typecheck; pre-push = unit + client tests only
  (fast, Docker-free — CI runs the full gate incl. integration/e2e). Both hooks fail
  loudly and block if the active Node major is below `.nvmrc`. Don't bypass with
  `--no-verify`; fix the failure.
- pnpm only. ESM only. Server imports use `.js` extensions.
- After every merge to main, post a TestFlight release recommendation
  (docs/RELEASING.md): "recommended: <reasons>" or "not needed". Versions
  come ONLY from annotated vX.Y.Z tags; API changes additive-only between
  tags.

## Recurring failures — read before you start

Every item below has actually happened here, most of them more than once, and
each cost a review round or a follow-up fix wave. They are ordered by how
often they recur.

1. **Changing UI without running `pnpm e2e`.** Three phases running, a task
   changed a component and left the e2e suite red because only
   `--project unit --project client` was run. The e2e job gates CI. **If your
   diff touches anything under `app/src/`, run `pnpm e2e` before you report
   done** — and `pnpm screenshots` too if you changed a screen's layout.
2. **Trusting the aggregate coverage gate.** The 90×4 threshold is repo-wide,
   so a brand-new file can ship with entire branches uncovered and the gate
   still passes. Four components did exactly that (keyboard handlers twice,
   error branches twice). **Check the per-file numbers for files you touched.**
3. **Fixtures that don't look like production data.** The name generator
   returned the same name forever against the real 35-workout library while
   every test passed, because the tests used an empty library. A whole phase's
   `wu`/`r` rendering branch shipped with an accessibility defect because every
   test and design sweep built `kind: "w"` rows. **Test against a realistic
   fixture — the seeded library, a stored workout, a populated form.**
4. **Asserting a thing exists instead of that it works.**
   `expect(typeof retry).toBe("function")` passes whether or not retry
   retries. **Invoke it and assert the consequence.** See docs/TESTING.md §3.
5. **Deleting a component and leaving its CSS.** Happened three times
   (`.col-*`, `.set-toggle`, `.field-dur`/`.field-spm`). **After deleting a
   component, grep its class names across `src/` and `e2e/` and remove the
   dead rules.**
6. **Judging contrast by eye.** A token shipped at 3.29:1 against a 4.5:1
   requirement and was only caught by a later automated scan. **Compute the
   ratio; put the number in your report.**
7. **Screenshots that capture empty states.** Committed screenshots are the
   PR's visual record and have twice shown fallback dashes or scrolled past
   the feature. **Seed real data, then open the image and look at it.**
8. **Hand-rolling the same ARIA pattern again.** There are already three
   roving-tabindex radiogroups; each shipped untested and needed a follow-up.
   **Reuse `PaceRefInput`/`ClassificationCard`'s pattern and copy its keyboard
   tests.**
9. **Letting `docs/design/DEVIATIONS.md` drift.** It documents *current state*,
   not history. Rows have described deleted code and contradicted each other.
   **When you change or remove something it describes, reconcile the row.**
10. **Assuming the plan is right.** Plans in this repo have contained factual
    errors — a route-ordering claim that the router made moot, a
    `DROP COLUMN` sequencing that would have broken rollback, a task split that
    was impossible because a type change forces compilation coupling. **If the
    brief contradicts what you observe, say so in your report instead of
    working around it silently.**

## Commands

- iOS: `pnpm ios:build` (tag-derived version; needs `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` env), `pnpm ios:open` (Xcode).
