## Phase 1 — Infra & continuous deployment

**Status:** Done
**Goal:** Every push to main lands on a real URL with zero manual steps.

- [x] Hardened multi-stage Dockerfiles (non-root, read-only, tmpfs, cap_drop ALL)
- [x] `compose.yml`: Postgres 18 (healthchecked volume), app, cloudflared under a `tunnel` profile
- [x] `/api/health` endpoint incl. DB connectivity check
- [x] `scripts/deploy.sh` (checkout CI-validated SHA → `compose up --build --wait` → auto-rollback on failed health gate) + tests for the script
- [x] CI `deploy` job on self-hosted runner, `production` environment
- [x] `.env.example` + secrets conventions (tunnel token, DB creds)

**Exit:** Hello-world Ergomatic reachable through the Cloudflare tunnel; a deliberately broken deploy rolls back automatically.
