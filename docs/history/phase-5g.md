## Phase 5G — MAX/MIN effort refs

**Status:** Done (2026-08-01, PR #TBD)
**Goal:** A workout can say "30 seconds max" or "20 minutes easy" — stored as
a real effort reference, not a stand-in offset.

**Design authority:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-01-phase-5g-effort-refs-design.md`.

- [x] `PaceRef` becomes a key-presence union (`SplitRef | EffortRef`,
      `isEffortRef`) — additive, every stored `{base, off}` ref stays valid
      and behaves byte-identically; one function (`estimationSplit`) owns
      turning an effort into a number for totals/filters, one function
      (`effortWord`) owns the `ALL OUT`/`EASY` display pair, and neither
      string appears anywhere else in the app
- [x] `checkRef`/validation/the bulk grammar all accept `max`/`min` with no
      offset (`max+2` fails parse and validation the same as before); bulk
      import reports per-line effort errors at the same precision as a bad
      split ref
- [x] `BuilderRow.refEffort` round-trips both arms through `toSteps`/
      `stepToRow`; a stored effort ref falling back to a split (e.g. an
      older client) resolves to `6k+0`, judged sane
- [x] The PACE control becomes a four-chip radiogroup (`2K | 6K | MAX |
MIN`) — checking an effort chip hides the offset stepper entirely
      (unmounted, not just visually hidden; efforts take no offset) and the
      TARGET strip shows the effort word instead of a resolved range
- [x] The detail screen (`StepRow`) renders an effort step as its word, with
      zero nudge buttons (a word has nothing to nudge) and no baseline
      dependency (an effort target resolves without one, unlike a split)
- [x] Seed audit: every one of the 35 starters' work steps checked by hand
      against `effort`-worthy phrasing in its own description; one changed
      (Microburst's 10×0:30 sprint, `2k−5` → `{effort:"max"}` — its own
      comment says "maximal short bursts", and `2k−5` was slower than an
      honest all-out), 42 kept, written up as an auditable table before the
      code changed
- [x] Mid-phase addition (James): the classification card's TYPE group
      shows a one-phrase summary word opposite its label, the same
      convention as EXPECTED PAIN's level word (`TYPE_WORDS`, `builderState.ts`)
      — AN "SPEED WORK", O2 "LOW & SLOW", AT "COMFORTABLY HARD", TR "HARD
      INTERVALS"; reuses the pain row's reserved-line-box fix so the word
      never shifts the chips below it
- [x] Structural e2e coverage for the whole feature (`e2e/builder.spec.ts`,
      `e2e/design.spec.ts` including a MAX-selected sweep — the
      hidden-stepper layout is its own state), and the builder/detail
      screenshots each carry a real `MAX`/`ALL OUT` step

**Exit:** MET — `0:30 max @ 32` authors, saves, and reopens showing `ALL
OUT` with no nudge controls, end to end.
