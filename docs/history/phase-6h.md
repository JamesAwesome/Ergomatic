## Phase 6H — News tab core

**Status:** Done (2026-08-07, PR #54)
**Goal:** A reading and orientation surface — News replaces Trend in the
tab bar, holds pinned explainers plus a rolling latest feed plus release
notes, and remembers what a rower has read across a reload and a second
device.
**Design authority:** `docs/design/handoffs/2026-08-07-news-tab/README.md`
(decisions 1–5 and 8 — News itself and the five-tab bar; decisions 6, 7,
and 9 — Today onboarding and You/Trend — are Phase 6I/6J's own, not this
phase's).

- [x] **Task 1 — `article_reads`**: the table (`user_id`, `slug`,
      `read_at`), its migration, and `ArticleReadsStore.{list,markRead}` —
      `markRead` idempotent-forever (`onConflictDoNothing`), no
      unread/delete route by design
- [x] **Task 2 — the two routes**: `GET /api/article-reads` (the signed-in
      rower's own read slugs) and `PUT /api/article-reads/:slug` (mark one
      read), both additive and session-guarded
- [x] **Task 3 — the content**: the `NewsArticle`/`ReleaseNote` types, a
      four-article registry (workout types + baselines pinned; picking a
      workout + pain scale in LATEST) of original in-app prose, and
      `RELEASE_NOTES` seeded retroactively (v0.5.1/v0.5.0/v0.4.0)
- [x] **Task 4 — `useArticleReads`**: optimistic reads (a PUT's failure
      leaves the article unread on the next fetch rather than surfacing an
      error), suppressing read/unread claims entirely while loading or on a
      failed fetch rather than guessing
- [x] **Task 5 — the News screen and the tab swap**: `News.tsx` at `/news`
      (PINNED block, LATEST feed, WHAT'S NEW card), the tab bar becomes
      TODAY · NEWS · LIBRARY · PLAN · YOU with TREND gone, and the
      no-`.button-l1`-anywhere rule (accent reserved for the unread square
      and text links, never a START)
- [x] **Task 6 — the reader and release notes**: `Reader.tsx` at
      `/news/:slug` (marks read on mount, a NEXT-unread footer, `BackLink`),
      `Releases.tsx` at `/news/releases` listing every `RELEASE_NOTES` entry
- [x] **Task 7 — close-out**: `news.spec.ts` (tab order, the 4→3 UNREAD
      read-and-reload proof against the real server, the reader's NEXT
      footer, `/news/releases`), `design.spec.ts` sweeps (axe on all three
      screens against a mixed read state, 44px targets, the no-`.button-l1`
      rule, the read row's `--ink-3`/400-weight contrast measured at 6.69:1
      against `--page` and 7.43:1 against `--surface`, the unread/read
      square colours), `news.png`/`news-reader.png`, and this record

**Exit:** MET — a fresh account sees four articles and 4 UNREAD; reading
one survives a reload and a second device (the server round-trip, not an
in-memory hook); TREND is gone. Full e2e green ×2 back-to-back (227/227)
plus screenshots and unit/client/integration (2408 tests, 98%+ across all
four coverage metrics).

**Next:** Phase 6I (Today onboarding) and Phase 6J (Trend charts on You),
below — both deliberately not this phase's scope.
