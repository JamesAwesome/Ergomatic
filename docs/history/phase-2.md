## Phase 2 — Auth

**Status:** Done
**Goal:** Multiple people can each sign in and get their own empty Ergomatic.

- [x] Google OAuth authorization-code flow (self-implemented or minimal library, no SaaS)
- [x] `users` table + Postgres-backed cookie sessions; session middleware; CSRF posture
- [x] Sign-in screen (design language: paper theme, serif titles)
- [x] Minimal **You** screen: signed-in identity + sign out
- [x] API auth guard: all data routes require a session, all data scoped to the user

**Exit:** Two different Google accounts see fully isolated data; deployed.
