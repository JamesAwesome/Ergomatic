## Phase 5H — Library custom badge/filter; the iOS callout fix

**Status:** Done (2026-08-01, PR #TBD)
**Goal:** A rower can tell their own authored workouts apart from the
starter library at a glance, and isolate them with a filter — plus close
out a device report that long-pressing a control on iOS popped the OS
text-selection callout instead of activating it.

- [x] A personal (non-global) workout's library row wears a `CUSTOM` badge
      on its second line (`WorkoutRow.tsx`); a `CUSTOM` filter chip
      (`FilterChips.tsx`) ANDs with every other filter exactly like `PAIN
≤3` — `ALL` clears it, and filtering to `CUSTOM` with no personal
      workouts renders a builder-link empty state instead of a bare "no
      matches" message
- [x] iOS device report (2026-08-01): long-pressing a button, chip,
      radiogroup option, workout row, or anchor-styled "button" popped
      Copy/Look Up/Translate instead of activating the control (WKWebView
      treats rendered text as selectable by default). One grouped
      `user-select: none` / `-webkit-touch-callout: none` rule in
      `index.css`'s reset block now covers every such control — see
      `docs/design/DEVIATIONS.md` for the exact selector list and what was
      deliberately left out
- [x] Typed fields stay selectable throughout: `input`/`textarea`, and
      specifically the `Stepper`/`ClockInput` value cells
      (`.stepper-value-input`, `.clock-input`), which share the
      `.stepper-value` class name with the non-editable span variant the
      callout fix does cover — the CSS selector is scoped to
      `span.stepper-value` for exactly this reason. Structural e2e coverage
      (`e2e/design.spec.ts`) asserts both directions: a chip/row/stepper-
      button/EDIT control computes `user-select: none`, and the Title field
      plus a typed SPM value computes something other than `none`
- [x] The library screenshot (`docs/screenshots/library.png`) shows a real
      custom workout wearing the badge, filtered via the `CUSTOM` chip

**Not verified here:** the callout's actual on-screen behaviour (Chromium
has no text-selection callout to reproduce or clear) — that's James's to
confirm on-device, post-merge, the same way every other WKWebView-only
behaviour in this app has been.

**Exit:** MET — the library can be filtered to exactly the rower's own
workouts, every row reads which ones those are without opening them, and
the callout-suppression rule ships with structural (computed-style) e2e
coverage plus the caveat above about what that coverage can't reach.
