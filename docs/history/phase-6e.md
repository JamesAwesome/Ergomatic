## Phase 6E — Workout library generation

**Status:** Done (2026-08-03, PR #TBD)
**Goal:** Replace the 35-workout starter library with ~300 original workouts,
structurally derived (never verbatim) from James's Erg Book photos, so
TestFlight testers have realistic content instead of a small, well-worn set.
**Design authority:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-03-workout-generation-design.md`,
plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-03-workout-generation.md`.

- [x] Offline five-stage pipeline: double-read vision extraction of the book
      photos → private `originals.json` and a personal originals CSV on
      James's Desktop (neither enters the repo) → a repo-safe aggregate
      pattern digest (`app/domain/generation/patterns.json` — per type×duration
      cell: interval-shape frequencies, work:rest ratio ranges, pace-offset
      distributions per base, spm bands, warm-up conventions, rep-count
      ranges; aggregate statistics only, no titles/prose/per-workout rows)
      → grid-constrained authoring by subagents → a permanent validation
      gate split across two layers: domain `validate.ts` for base workout
      validity, and `app/server/seed/library/library.test.ts` for the
      spm/pain-plausibility bands, structural dedup, easy→hard ordering,
      and the exact quota grid
- [x] Exact quota grid, 300 total: O2 90 / AT 75 / TR 75 / AN 60 across five
      duration bands (<20′ 30, 20–30′ 75, 30–45′ 120, 45–60′ 45, 60′+ 30); a
      ~320-name weather/atmospheric pool allocated per cell so authoring
      agents can't collide; an offline no-structure+parameter-clone check
      against the private originals (can't live in CI — it needs book
      content — so it ran once during the phase and its result is recorded
      in the PR)
- [x] `STARTER_WORKOUTS`/`server/seed/starter.ts` retired entirely;
      `server/seed/library/{o2,at,tr,an}.ts` hold the 300 as original
      content, `sortOrder` grouped by type then easy→hard (the same
      browsing order the 35-workout library used). `seedGlobalLibrary`
      (`server/seed/seed.ts`) converges the shared global library to the
      code's set, keyed by title, inside one advisory-locked transaction:
      content changed → update the existing row in place (its id, and any
      session-log's link to it, survive); title missing → insert; title
      removed → delete (`session_logs.workout_id` nulls via
      `ON DELETE SET NULL` for those rows only); identical state writes
      nothing — called once at boot, not per-user. (2026-08-04,
      library-converge: superseded this bullet's original title-set swap,
      whose gap was that a content-only edit to an already-deployed title
      never reached the running set until the title itself changed. The
      converge closes that — content edits now reach a deployed volume on
      the next boot alone, no reseed dance required — and logs keep their
      workout link across a content edit; only an actual rename or removal
      still nulls it.) Personal (non-global) workouts are structurally
      untouched: globals are structurally un-editable by users (the store's
      `update()`/`remove()` only ever match rows scoped to a `userId`, never
      `user_id IS NULL`)
- [x] Fixtures across the client/server test suites re-anchored from the
      retired 35-workout set to real entries in the 300 (e.g. "Fork
      Lightning" for the effort-ref `0:30 @ MAX` shape, "Hoarfrost" for the
      warm-up-then-split-ref shape, "Filling Low" for the reps-expanded
      distance shape, "Sea Fret" for the first-sorted global)

**Exit:** MET — new and existing accounts alike see the same generated
300-workout global library; the seed converge is idempotent (an unchanged
set no-ops on a second boot), a content-only edit to an existing title
reaches the running set on the next boot without any title change, and a
title rename/removal still converges cleanly; personal workouts and their
logs are structurally unaffected either way.
