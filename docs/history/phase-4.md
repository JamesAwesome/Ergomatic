## Phase 4 — Domain engine & schema

**Status:** Done
**Goal:** The Erg Book math, encoded once, pure, and heavily tested.

- [x] Drizzle schema + migrations: baselines, workouts + steps, session logs (with frozen paces), plan progress, preferences, test history — all per-user _(migration infrastructure + users/sessions landed in Phase 2; this item adds the domain tables)_
- [x] Pure domain module (no framework imports): pace resolution (`baseline + off + nudge`), tolerance ranges, `m:ss` formatting, phase expansion (`liveSteps()`/`phases()` incl. reps and rest insertion), pace-ref parser (`^(2k|6k)\s*([+-]?\d+(\.\d+)?)?$`), plan preset sequences (sprint / head race, 84 sessions, test placements), suggestion engine (`plan[doneN]` → filtered/sorted pool)
- [x] **Distance-based work steps as a first-class axis**: a work step is `{kind:'time', minutes}` OR `{kind:'distance', meters}` (e.g. `2500m at 2k-4`); displayed workout duration estimates distance steps from the resolved target pace (labeled estimate); schema's log steps carry per-step actuals from day one: `{targetSplit, actualSplit?, actualSource: 'assumed'|'stopwatch'|'pm5'}` (expand-only discipline: model now, never migrate later)
- [x] Heaviest unit-test coverage in the app; canonical fixtures (e.g. Lucky Penny → 25 phases / 50 min)
- [x] Scales per the differentiation spec: `pain: 1..5`, `difficulty: 'easy'|'medium'|'hard'` (see docs/design/DEVIATIONS.md)
- [x] **Original starter library** (~35 workouts, original names, all types × difficulties × time bands, time AND distance steps) authored as reviewable data, James-approved, seeded per-user at account creation; replaces the book-derived dev samples entirely

**Exit:** Every formula and behavior in the handoff's "Domain model" section has a passing test; integration tests prove per-user round-trips through Postgres.
